# OssicoNN

OssicoNN is a machine learning code designed to process stellar high-resolution spectroscopy data from GIRAFFE instruments using the Freia framework. This repository includes three essential files:
* conditioning_ossiconn.py .
* conditional_ossiconn.
* ossiconn.pt

which define the model architecture and hyperparameters.
